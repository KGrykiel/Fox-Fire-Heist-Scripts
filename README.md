# Fox-Fire-Heist-Scripts

This repository contains all custom scripts used in the **Fox Fire Heist** project, a 3D physics-based puzzle game developed in Unity. You can preview the game [here](https://kgrykiel.github.io/projects/fox-fire/).

## About the Game

**Fox Fire Heist** was created over the course of two months as part of university coursework. It draws inspiration from the Chinese folktale “Fox-Fire,” reimagined as a steampunk heist aboard a floating airship. The player takes on the role of a protagonist attempting to steal a magical power source from a wealthy magnate.

The game emphasizes seamless environmental interaction, where puzzles are integrated naturally into the world rather than isolated sections. All gameplay systems were implemented using Unity and C#, with most 3D assets modeled in Blender.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes all custom scripts written to implement the game’s core systems. Much of the engineering was done within the Unity editor, but these scripts form the backbone of the gameplay mechanics.

### Features

- **Physics-Based Interaction System**  
  Manipulate objects using Unity’s built-in physics, including levers, buttons, and movable props.

- **Destruction System**  
  Enables breakable objects to respond dynamically to player actions.

- **Steam Flow Tracking**  
  Simulates steam movement through pipes, used in puzzle mechanics.

- **Object Controllers**  
  Custom scripts for controlling elevators, valves, furnaces, and other interactive elements.

- **UI Management**  
  Handles in-game user interface elements and feedback systems.

## Game Areas

The game is divided into three main levels, each with unique puzzles and mechanics:
- **Cargo Bay** – Tutorial and introduction to core mechanics.
- **Lobby** – Central area with the most complex puzzle design.
- **Engine Room** – Final challenge and climax of the heist.

## Contributions

Developed solo, with responsibilities including:
- Game & Level Design
- Scripting & Lighting
- 3D Modeling & Animation
- Texturing (with some assets sourced externally)
